# First Things First or TLDR
If you're reading this, you've looked at the ReadMe either on GitHub or locally, and are wondering "Is there anything simpler?".

This site was build from a licensed Bootstrap Theme:  [Profi - Landing Pages for Small Businesses](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/profi-bootstrap-landing-pages-for-small-business/).  A Standard License (Single Site) was purchased. 

You'll notice that is requires Node and a number of modules, BUT it only uses Node Modules for building the code but the output (/build) can run on a vanilla Linux/Apache or Windows/IIS/WebApp server.  Deployment is simply copying /build to the web root.

Setup (from a CLI like Bash)
1. Clone the repo to a new folder. ($ git clone https://github.com/jrbirdmanOH/DCMorrison-New.git)
2. $ CD DCMorrison-New
3. Install Node if you haven't already (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
4. $ npm install
5. $ npm run build
6. $ npm start
7. Open "http://localhost:3000" to view the site.

Open folder in whatever IDE you prefer (I used VSCode).
