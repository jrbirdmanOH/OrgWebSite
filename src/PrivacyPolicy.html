                <p>Thayer Birding Software (TBS) values its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") will help you understand
                how we collect and use personal information from those who visit our website or make use of our online facilities and
                services, and what we will and will not do with the information we collect. Our Policy has been designed and created to ensure
                those affiliated with The TBS of our commitment and realization of our obligation not only to meet, but to
                exceed, most existing privacy standards.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any given time. If you want to make sure that you are up to date with
                the latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page. If at any point in time The TBS decides to
                make use of any personally identifiable information on file, in a manner vastly different from that which was stated when this
                information was initially collected, the user or users shall be promptly notified by email. Users at that time shall have the
                option as to whether to permit the use of their information in this separate manner.</p>
                <p>This Policy applies to The TBS, and it governs any and all data collection and usage by us. Through the
                use of thayerbirdingsoftware.org, you are therefore consenting to the data collection procedures expressed in this Policy.
                Please note that this Policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that TBS does not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by us. If you visit a website that we mention or link to,
                be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information. It is highly recommended and suggested that you
                review the privacy policies and statements of any website you choose to use or frequent to better understand the way in
                which websites garner, make use of and share the information collected.</p>
                <p>Specifically, this Policy will inform you of the following</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our website;</li>
                    <li>Why we collect personally identifiable information and the legal basis for such collection;</li>
                    <li>How we use the collected information and with whom it may be shared;</li>
                    <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data; and</li>
                    <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>It is always up to you whether to disclose personally identifiable information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we
                reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services. This website collects various
                types of information, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information automatically collected when visiting our website, which may include cookies, third party tracking
                        technologies and server logs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, The TBS may have the occasion to collect non-personal anonymous demographic
                information, such as age, gender, household income, political affiliation, race and religion, as well as the type of browser you
                are using, IP address, or type of operating system, which will assist us in providing and maintaining superior quality service.</p>
                <p>The TBS may also deem it necessary, from time to time, to follow websites that our users may frequent to
                gleam what types of services and products may be the most popular to customers or the general public.</p>
                <p>Please rest assured that this site will only collect personal information that you knowingly and willingly provide to us by way of
                surveys, completed membership forms, and emails. It is the intent of this site to use personal information only for the purpose
                for which it was requested, and any additional uses specifically provided for on this Policy.</p>
                <h3>Why We Collect Information and For How Long</h3>

                <p>The data we collect from you will be stored for no longer than necessary. The length of time we retain said information will be

                associations; the type of contract we have with you, the existence of your consent, and our legitimate interest in keeping such
                information as stated in this Policy.</p>

                newsletters. To discontinue or unsubscribe from our website please send an email that you wish to unsubscribe to

                <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
                <p>Our website does contain links to affiliate and other websites. The TBS does not claim nor accept
                responsibility for any privacy policies, practices and/or procedures of other such websites. Therefore, we encourage all users
                and visitors to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements of every website that collects
                personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy Agreement applies only and solely to the information collected by our

                <h3>Notice to European Union Users</h3>
                <p>The TBS's operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide information to us, the
                information will be transferred out of the European Union (EU) and sent to the United States. (The adequacy decision on the
                EU-US Privacy became operational on August 1, 2016. This framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone in the EU
                whose personal data is transferred to the United States for commercial purposes. It allows the free transfer of data to
                companies that are certified in the US under the Privacy Shield.) By providing personal information to us, you are consenting
                to its storage and use as described in this Policy.</p>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>The TBS takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the
                website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (e.g. credit card
                information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon
                in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the webpage.
                While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only
                employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to
                personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in
                a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the
                user's personal information under our control.</p>
                <h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
                <p>By using this website, you are hereby accepting the terms and conditions stipulated within the Privacy Policy Agreement. If
                you are not in agreement with our terms and conditions, then you should refrain from further use of our sites. In addition, your
                continued use of our website following the posting of any updates or changes to our terms and conditions shall mean that you
                agree and acceptance of such changes.</p>
                <h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
